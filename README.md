# RCSB Embedding Model

**Version** 0.0.19


## Overview

RCSB Embedding Model is a neural network architecture designed to encode macromolecular 3D structures into fixed-length vector embeddings for efficient large-scale structure similarity search.

Preprint: [Multi-scale structural similarity embedding search across entire proteomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.640875v1).

A web-based implementation using this model for structure similarity search is available at [rcsb-embedding-search](http://embedding-search.rcsb.org).

If you are interested in training the model with a new dataset, visit the [rcsb-embedding-search repository](https://github.com/bioinsilico/rcsb-embedding-search), which provides scripts and documentation for training.

## Quick Start

### CLI

    # 1. Compute residue embeddings: Calculate residue level embeddings of protein structures using ESM3. Predictions are stored as torch tensor files.
    inference residue-embedding --src-file data/structures.csv --output-path results/residue_embeddings --structure-format mmcif --batch-size 8 --devices auto

    # 2. Compute structure embeddings: Calculate single-chain protein embeddings from structural files. Predictions are stored in a single pandas DataFrame file.
    inference structure-embedding --src-file data/structures.csv --output-path results/residue_embeddings --out-df-name df-res-embeddings --batch-size 4 --devices 0 --devives 1

    # 3. Compute chain embeddings: Calculate single-chain protein embeddings from residue level embeddings stored as torch tensor files. Predictions a re stored as csv files.
    inference chain-embedding --src-file data/structures.csv --output-path results/chain_embeddings --batch-size 4

    # 4. Compute assembly embeddings: Calculate assembly embeddings from residue level embeddings stored as torch tensor files. Predictions are stored as csv files.
    inference assembly-embedding --src-file data/structures.csv --res-embedding-location results/residue_embeddings --output-path results/assembly_embeddings

### Python API

    from rcsb_embedding_model import RcsbStructureEmbedding

    model = RcsbStructureEmbedding()

    # Compute per-residue embeddings
    res_emb = model.residue_embedding(
        src_structure="examples/1abc.cif",
        src_format="mmcif",
        chain_id="A"
    )

    # Aggregate to structure-level embedding
    struct_emb = model.aggregator_embedding(res_emb)

See the examples and tests directories for more use cases.

## Model Architecture

The embedding model is trained to predict structural similarity by approximating TM-scores using cosine distances between embeddings. It consists of two main components:

- **Protein Language Model (PLM)**: Computes residue-level embeddings from a given 3D structure.
- **Residue Embedding Aggregator**: A transformer-based neural network that aggregates these residue-level embeddings into a single vector.

### **Protein Language Model (PLM)**
Residue-wise embeddings of protein structures are computed using the [ESM3](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/) generative protein language model.

### **Residue Embedding Aggregator**
The aggregation component consists of six transformer encoder layers, each with a 3,072-neuron feedforward layer and ReLU activations. After processing through these layers, a summation pooling operation is applied, followed by 12 fully connected residual layers that refine the embeddings into a single 1,536-dimensional vector.
